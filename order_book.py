#general description of an orderbook
""" an order book is a list of buyers and sellers willing to engage in trade, usually trading financial securities.
the order book stores buyers and sellers according to the price they are willing to meet, units willing to buy/sell
among other things.
A matching algorithm is then employed to match a buyer to a seller [given certain criteria are met, like price, among other things]
This makes the order book dynamic as there is an inflow of buyers/sellers and an outflow as they are matched to one another"""
